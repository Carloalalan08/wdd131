Project Proposal Submission (Week 4)
Here's how you can structure your proposal:

1. Subject of the Website:
Bigger Whale - A Printing Press Business

2. Planned Content:
The website will feature the following pages:
    Home – Introduction to Bigger Whale, its mission, and key services.
    Services – A detailed breakdown of printing services offered (business cards, flyers, tarpaulins, brochures, etc.).
    Portfolio – Showcase of past works to highlight quality and creativity.
    Contact Us – A form where customers can inquire about services, request quotes, or visit the shop.

Additional features:

Customer testimonials for credibility.

Price estimates or an interactive service quote calculator.

A blog or news section to share updates and promotions.

3. Reason for Choosing This Subject:
Bigger Whale currently has no online presence, which limits its marketing reach. A website will help attract more customers, provide a convenient way to inquire about services, and showcase the business’s work to potential clients. Since I am working there, I can gather accurate content and design it to align with the company’s branding.
